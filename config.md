# Defer Cards Add-on Configuration

## hotkey
Defines the keyboard shortcut used to trigger the 'Defer' action. This allows you to easily postpone reviewing a card to a later time without clicking any buttons.

Example: If you set the hotkey to "D", pressing "D" during a review session will defer the current card.

## show_defer_button
Determines whether or not a 'Defer' button is displayed on the review screen. Clicking this button will have the same effect as using the hotkey.

Options: 
- `True`: Show the 'Defer' button.
- `False`: Hide the 'Defer' button.

### Warning
Be cautious of becoming overly reliant on deferring cards, as it can hinder the effectiveness of the spaced repetition algorithm. If you find yourself abusing this feature, consider disabling the button and use the hotkey or menu options for more intentional deferring.
