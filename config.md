# Defer Cards Add-on Configuration

## hotkey
Defines the keyboard shortcut used to trigger the 'Defer' action. This allows you to easily postpone reviewing a card to a later time without needing to navigate through menus.

Example: If you set the hotkey to "\_", pressing "\_" during a review session will defer the current card.

You can change this hotkey to any other key that suits your preferences.

## showButton
Controls whether the custom "Meu Bot√£o" button should be displayed next to the "More" button during review sessions. 

If set to `true`, the button will be visible and allow you to trigger the defer action by clicking on it. If set to `false`, the button will be hidden, and you will only be able to defer cards using the keyboard shortcut defined in `hotkey`.

### Warning
Be cautious of becoming overly reliant on deferring cards, as it can hinder the effectiveness of the spaced repetition algorithm.

If you find yourself abusing this feature, consider using the menu options for more intentional deferring.
